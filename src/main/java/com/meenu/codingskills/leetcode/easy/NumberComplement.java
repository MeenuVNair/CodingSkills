/*
 * Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Example 1:
------------------
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
 
Example 2:
-----------------
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
